# Be aware! The database variables are used on INITIAL STARTUP of the database container only. So change these to appropriate values BEFORE creating the database container.
# If you end up needing to change the database password, the easiest way would be to wipe the whole db:
# run docker compose down -v and then delete the folder ./docker-data/postgres
# I think kungsbacka had problems when they had a hash sign "#" or parentheses "(" in their database password.
# I haven't verified this, but perhaps avoid those characters for this password?
